A Sublime syntax-definition for Smali. Just check the repo out to your Sublime Text 2 packages directory, and you should be good to go. I wrote this at 3:00 AM, so stuff is probably missing, and definitely buggy.

Installation:
* Locate Sublime's Packages directory
  Command + Shift + P, "Preferences: Browse Packages"
* Create a directory called Smali
* Copy smali.tmlanguage into Smali directory
* Sublime should open the next Smali file with highlighting and does not need to be restarted
